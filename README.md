## Using this project

You'll need the Ionic CLI with support for v3 apps:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic@3.20.0.
```

## Creating project

Ionic relies on two dependencies: 
- Ionic Command Line Utility
  - Enables you to use command line commands to easily create Ionic apps
  
  Create New Project Example:
  ```
  $ ionic start <name>
  $ cd ./name
  $ ionic server
  ```
  
- Cordova
  - Enables native capabilties in your apps
  
  iOS Example:

## Start the project
The project is started with the regular ionic commands.

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `ionic serve` to start the development environment.
3. To build the project run `ionic build android` or `ionic build ios`. In order for you to build an iOS app, you need to run on MacOS.

An alternative is to emulate the app on a device or upload it to the ionic cloud. From here you can download the ionic view app and use the app on all devices.

  
 # Further development
we have to youse v3 documentation not v4 documentations
